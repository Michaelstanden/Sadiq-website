<div class="column about-text" >The Chosen Haram is a circus theatre show that tells the story of two queer men and their chance meeting 
through a dating app. It portrays the highs and lows of their relationship and the barriers that they face. 
Performed on two Chinese Poles the story is mixed with gravity defying tricks and choreography to make even 
the most stoic hearts melt.
<br>
The show covers themes around sexuality, faith, addiction and connection.
<br> 
A message from the artist: 
“This show is a part of my life experience and the researched experience of others, both queer Muslims and ex-Muslims. Growing up I had the realisation that my sexuality didn’t connect with what I was being taught about my faith and the world around me. This left me as a young queer person confused and full of self-loathing and shame. To deal with those feelings 
I had to numb the world around me and then found myself shrouded in addiction. This story is not uncommon and many queer people experience elements of it.
I split this story into two characters and I bring those characters and their issues together to find unity. By creating these characters I can explore and present these issues in the format of the relationship that we see in this work. There is not often a representation of these issues on stage. As queer intimacy, particularly within circus, is almost non existent. There seems to be a wave of change happening in this right now and 
I am pleased to be able to use my experience and my life to enable that representation for others.”
