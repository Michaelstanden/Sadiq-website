# Sadiq-website
A wesbite built by myself using css, html and some simple javascript for a client who wanted a website to showcase thier artistic talents
They wanted a soho, dark and edgy theme whilst still remaining corporate enough for bookings.

I created a neon effect text and kept to clean, eyecatching and simplistic style design that shows a lot of images, and bold colours to catch users eyes.

Client requested a initial page for users to click on to enter.

A live link to see the site can be found <a href="https://michaelstanden.github.io/Sadiq-website/" target="_blank"> Here </a>
